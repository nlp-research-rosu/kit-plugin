# Reading an underdetermined natural-language contract

Use these conventions when the property to prove is stated as a
docstring-style natural-language contract — a description, worked
examples, implicit conventions — with a presumed naive reference
implementation as the ground truth for whatever the text leaves
unstated. Spec writers apply the conventions when drafting claims;
spec auditors judge domain and reading choices by the same
conventions, so both load this file.

The concrete rules below are stated for Python reference code — here
is the Python example set, the common case for docstring contracts.
For another reference language, keep the two-level structure (the
contract's plain meaning first, the naive reference idiom for its
silences) and substitute that language's naive idioms.

## The docstring is the contract; idioms fill its silences

The docstring's plain natural-language meaning is the ground truth. Where
its words determine behavior — stated inclusion criteria, worked examples,
explicit descriptions — implement that meaning directly, even when a
habitual reference-implementation shortcut would differ (a "count the
digits" criterion includes a two-digit negative regardless of how a naive
`len(str(x))` spelling would classify the sign). Two consequences:

- **Character-class predicates mean the stated class, not a proxy.**
  "Letters" means alphabetic characters — including ones with no upper or
  lower case; a case-based test is a different predicate. "Digits" means
  digit characters, not a sign-dependent string length.
- **Cover the stated class completely.** If the contract names a class
  (letters, digits, whitespace), handle every member the model can
  represent, and document the model's boundary for the rest.

Only where the docstring is genuinely silent — unspecified edge behavior,
tie-breaking it does not mention, exotic inputs outside its stated
domain — fill the gap with the most direct naive Python transcription of
the docstring's nouns, because reference implementations are written that
way, and record the chosen reading:

- **Use the literal naive expression, not an equivalent reformulation.**
  Digit extraction is `x % 10` with Python's modulo semantics (so the
  "unit digit" of a negative number follows `-1 % 10 == 9`), not an
  abs-normalized variant, unless the docstring states otherwise.
- **Size and digit-count predicates are string-length predicates.**
  "At most N digits" in reference code is habitually
  `len(str(x)) <= N`, which counts a minus sign as a character.
- **Transformations specified on a stated alphabet pass other input
  through unchanged.** "Rotate the letters" with lowercase examples means
  characters outside the stated alphabet are emitted verbatim, not
  transformed, dropped, or rejected.
- **Split and scan only what the stated delimiter consumes.** Do not
  strip, collapse, or normalize whitespace beyond what the delimiter
  pattern itself consumes; a fragment's leading or trailing characters
  are part of the fragment.
- **Tests written on the textual form stay textual.** When reference code
  classifies an input by its string shape — a suffix, prefix, length, or
  substring test on the raw text — implement that same string test, never
  a numeric reformulation. Parsing collapses textually distinct inputs
  (trailing zeros, signs, exponent spellings) that the string test
  distinguishes, so an arithmetically equivalent tie or shape check is a
  different function on the full string domain.

These are conventions of how Python reference code is written, not
task-specific facts. When two readings survive, prefer the one the naive
one-line Python implementation would produce, state the choice in the
scope record, and cover the chosen reading's full domain.

## A contradicted example is a documentation defect

**A self-contradicted worked example is not a proof-domain failure.** When
a contract's own definition and one of its worked examples disagree — the
example's stated output is not what the defined operation yields on the
example's input — the definition wins. Implement the definition, record the
contradicted example in the scope record with the computed-versus-stated
divergence, exclude nothing else, and submit the full-domain theorem. Do
not downgrade the report or stop at partial because the contradicted
example fails: an example inconsistent with its own contract cannot be an
obligation, and gating on it converts a documentation defect into a lost
proof.
